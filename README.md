## Project 1 Information
- Used the CLI of my operating system to create a number of folders
- Listed the folders in a tree-like structure
- Used the ping command, and practiced using the break keyboard sequence
- Created and executed JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

From this project, I gained familiarity with a lot of concepts that would be helpful later on in the course.
